## Coding Rules

- **Styleguide**
- Use scss scoped
- Mix scss when there are multiple css in common use
- Create a file and import it for the screen. Name the file based on the screen name.
Ex: `HomePage.scss` `SettingPage.vue` 
- The distance between two functions is 1 enter
- Limit the use of const, let, var
- File names must be multiple words

- **Git flow**

1. Branch naming prefix:  
   **Accepted** prefix:  
   ✔️ `feat/` for adding / developing a feature in here  
   ✔️ `hotfix/` for adding / developing a hotfix that's not normal flow  
   ✔️ `fix/` for adding / developing a bug fix in here  
   ✔️ `cr/` for update customer change request after feature is merged in one sprint  
   ex: `feat/issue-001` `feat/issue-001-v2` `feat/issue-001-dev` `fix/issue-001-stg` `hotfix/banner-style`

2. Commit - Lint:  
   run `yarn lint` before commit -> fix wrong format to till it clean
   Tip: can use `yarn lintfix` to fix auto

3. Merge - double check (mindset):  
   resolve `conflict`  
   check `merge target`  
   remove all debugger: ex: `console.log` `console.error`  
   remove all variable created but not used
   double check code with previos revision (`diff check`), control `infulence level`

## Issues - Fix guide

1. **Husky Hooks and Windows Compatibility with GitHub Desktop**

   > If you're using a third-party GUI like GitHub Desktop for managing Git commits in Windows, you may get an error that `bash` is a command not found.
   >
   > This error commonly occurs when trying to run package manager based scripts, like the "npx lint-staged" command, as part of your husky pre-commit hooks.
   >
   > To fix this error, you'll need to add the Git for Windows tools to your PATH by either:
   >
   > 1. Choosing "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the command prompt" in the Git for Windows installer, or
   > 2. Adding "C:/Program Files/Git/bin" [or your appropriate installation location] to the PATH manually as an Environmental Variable in Windows. (Both: User variables, System variables)
   >
   > Similar issues have been reported for the Node Version Manager program nvm on \*nix systems, but those issues are addressed in the "command not found" section of the docs, which explains using a > ~/.huskyrc file.

2. **Windows git "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF"**
   > run `git config --global core.autocrlf false`
